Students will identify their preferred programs available in dream colleges with the aid of our project.
1. Our database will include a list of universities and colleges that offer various courses, along with the criteria used for selection.
2. The database will recommend the appropriate university and the courses the student can take based on a scan of their profile.
3. The students can filter the start of the program(Spring/Fall/Summer), and the database will compare their profiles to make a suggestion for them.
4. Students will also be able to make a decision based on the Visa acceptance rate of the university.
